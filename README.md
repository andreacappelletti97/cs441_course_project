# Course Project
### The goal of this course project is to gain experience with creating a streaming data pipeline with cloud computing technologies by designing and implementing an actor-model service using [Akka](https://akka.io/) that ingests logfile generated data in real time and delivers it via an event-based service called [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) to [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) for further processing. This is a group project with each group consisting of one to six students. No student can participate in more than one group.

## Project
This repository is organized into X different subprojects.

- LogFileGenerator

The following sections describe the functionalities implemented in all of them.

# LogFileGenerator

The first project, logGenerator, provides an extension of the log generator coded by Professor Mark.


## Programming technology
All the simulations has been written in Scala using a Functional Programming approach.

While writing the simulations the following best practices has been adopted

- Large usage of logging to understand the system status;


- Configuration libraries and files to provide input values for the simulations;


- No while or for loop is present, instead recursive functions are largely used into the project.


- Modular architecture (code is divided by module to enhance maintainability)
